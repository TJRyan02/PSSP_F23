Unless there's a proper system for finances set up for individuals in that category, I don't think it would be the most efficient policy.",

Americans would be able to breathe cleaner air and also wouldn’t rely on gas(which obviously fluctuates highly in price because of gas corporations’ need for profit). Also there would be uniformity in the types of cars so individuals wouldn’t have to worry about concerns of not being able to access certain services because of what they drive.",

Currently, global warming is impacting cities worldwide, with some coastal cities being submerged underwater, destroying homes and places for people to live. Additionally, the drastic weather changes is also affected by global warming. In our current situation, it's in our best interest to pursue battery-powered cars than continue to emit carbon into the atmosphere.",
