Most teachers would not be able to stop an aggressive student attempting to take their gun. I think guns on campus would not raise safety but raise paranoia. Teachers are not trained to be professionals with firearms, and they shouldn't have to be.",

What benefit would it be for a teacher to have a gun in the classroom, when the students can easily access the gun. There are too many factors for missuse and mistakes that could be very harmful, and it is not worth the risk to introduce guns to the classroom as a means of curbing shootings.",

So instead of fueling fire with fire, we should aim to get to the root of the problem - unregulated access to firearms. With comprehensive gun laws and thorough background checks there would be no other reason why a teacher would need a gun in a K-12 school.",
