Although many of us may not feel the impacts yet, we will soon if we continue to produce emissions at this rate. Changes in how cars are powered makes little difference in the use by consumers (especially if subsidies keep the prices similar) yet will have significant, positive, long term effects on our planet and therefore our qualities of life.",

If we use more electronically powered vehicles, it will help to prevent further damage to the environment like climate change. Climate change is something that even the little things can incredibly help, and this is one that can.",

To reduce the dependency we have on raw materials whose supply is not assured for example Russian oil being boycotted led to a huge surge in gas prices but if we had electric/renewable power for those cars communities wouldn’t have been as disrupted.<br><br>2. The environment is going through immense degradation due to the drilling for oil and causing long lasting damage to communities eg Niger delta in Nigeria and how even after thirty years they still can’t farm or fish on their land. This harm will only continue as we persist on using oil. <br><br>3. Global Warming is increasing exponentially and action needs to occur to slow it down. Every year we are seeing the devastating tip of the iceberg of the harms we are going to face in the coming years due to the immense heat. My greatest fear is the mutation and adaptation of microbes that could not thrive in human bodies because of our warmth being able to survive in us.",

Changing the composition of gas-powered cars will allow for a monumental decrease in the amount of fossil fuels emitted from cars and other automobiles. With this change, global climate change will not completely be reversed, but this will certainly help to lessen its effects that are becoming more prominent in the world.",
