	"name_arg1" : "Supporting the phasing out of new gas-powered car engines by 2030 is a proactive step in addressing critical environmental and societal challenges. First and foremost, the transportation sector is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are the leading cause of climate change. Transitioning to electric vehicles by 2030 would substantially reduce carbon emissions, helping to mitigate the catastrophic effects of global warming.<br><br>Moreover, the shift to EVs can enhance air quality in urban areas. Gasoline and diesel engines emit harmful pollutants that jeopardize public health, causing respiratory problems and premature deaths. By replacing these engines with clean and efficient electric propulsion, we can reduce smog, lower healthcare costs, and improve the quality of life for millions.<br><br>The economic rationale for this transition is compelling as well. EV technology is rapidly advancing, and the manufacturing of EVs and their components has the potential to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. The market for electric vehicles is also expanding, offering exciting opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship.<br><br>Additionally, ending the production of new gas-powered car engines by 2030 can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, contributing to energy security and decreasing the volatility of oil prices. It aligns with broader energy transition goals, ensuring that we invest in cleaner and more sustainable sources of power.",

The process of obtaining the power for electric vehicles is highly destructive and often violates many human rights in the process. Instead, we should focus on increasing and improving public transit systems and city infrastructure.",

One of the major hurdles in this process of slowing the climate crisis is that car companies are not incentivized to produce these cars. If we can show that there is something in it for the car companies, we can take a proactive step into reversing the climate crisis.",
