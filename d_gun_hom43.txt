	"name_arg1" : "Teachers and school officials should not be given the responsibility of possessing guns with the intention of defense if a threat should impose on campus. Firing a gun at a threat is outside the scope of what a teacher signs up for. Possessing a gun around numerous minors adds another level of pressure onto teachers and faculty. What if a student were to steal the firearm, the teacher or faculty member would most likely be assumed reliable for the theft.",

The money that could be used to buy a gun for each teacher and train them on how to use them could instead be used on security measures to protect a school from potential attackers.",

People are scared that they have no way to defend themselves or others. Along with mandatory training and education on how/when guns should be used, I think that teachers and school officials should have some way to defend themselves and their students. This is a preventative step in order to save more lives than we would lose and it is sad that we even have to think of this as a possibility.",
