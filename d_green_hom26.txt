This is a crucial step in addressing climate change, as the transportation sector is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. By promoting electric vehicles (EVs), we can significantly reduce carbon emissions, aligning with global efforts to combat climate change and limit temperature rise.<br><br>The transition to electric vehicles also presents economic opportunities. It can stimulate innovation, create jobs in the clean energy sector, and position the United States as a leader in the EV industry. The public health benefits are also significant, as it will lead to improved air quality, reducing health issues caused by vehicle emissions.<br><br>Ending the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035 is an approach that addresses climate change, fosters economic growth, and improves public health.",

	"name_arg2" : "Supporting the phasing out of new gas-powered car engines by 2030 is a proactive step in addressing critical environmental and societal challenges. First and foremost, the transportation sector is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are the leading cause of climate change. Transitioning to electric vehicles by 2030 would substantially reduce carbon emissions, helping to mitigate the catastrophic effects of global warming.<br><br>Moreover, the shift to EVs can enhance air quality in urban areas. Gasoline and diesel engines emit harmful pollutants that jeopardize public health, causing respiratory problems and premature deaths. By replacing these engines with clean and efficient electric propulsion, we can reduce smog, lower healthcare costs, and improve the quality of life for millions.<br><br>The economic rationale for this transition is compelling as well. EV technology is rapidly advancing, and the manufacturing of EVs and their components has the potential to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. The market for electric vehicles is also expanding, offering exciting opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship.<br><br>Additionally, ending the production of new gas-powered car engines by 2030 can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, contributing to energy security and decreasing the volatility of oil prices. It aligns with broader energy transition goals, ensuring that we invest in cleaner and more sustainable sources of power.",

	"name_arg3" : "I am in favor of a proposal to end the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. I strongly believe that our government should be taking more drastic measures to halt climate change. Although little things like promoting reusable materials instead of trash and more small environmentally friendly businesses are helpful, they are not enough. What we really need to focus on to make a change is big corporations, and forcing the car industry to become more environmentally friendly would make a huge change. I am only moderately in favor of this proposal, however, because I know that financially, it would be very challenging and require a lot of resources to charge the cars.",

Changing the composition of gas-powered cars will allow for a monumental decrease in the amount of fossil fuels emitted from cars and other automobiles. With this change, global climate change will not completely be reversed, but this will certainly help to lessen its effects that are becoming more prominent in the world.",
