We should be focusing more on removing the threat of guns entirely by introducing stricter gun regulation and education in schools. Having guns in school also poses a danger, if a child was to gain access it.",

Giving teachers guns would decentivize the teachers we actually need in the system and incentivize those who want guns to became teachers. No teacher needs a gun. This only provides more of a threat for children who are already being failed by the system.",

A teacher's primary purpose is to teach, putting a gun in their hands is a safety risk because the likely case is they do not know how to properly use a gun. If a teacher is careless and forgets to lock the gun away, it poses a risk. It would also cost money and investment to buy guns and train teachers how to use them in school and that money could be invested better into making the school better. Overall, it just poses unnecessary risks and costs money.",
