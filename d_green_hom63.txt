I think it would be more feasible to stop the production of gas-powered cars by 2035, however completely stopping people from selling used cars or newly produced gas-powered cars seems unlikely.",

This promotes sustainability, reduces dependence on fossil fuels, and would be a catalyst for the adoption of cleaner technologies. While there are challenges to consider, like infrastructure development, it aligns with environmental goals and technological advancements, driving more sustainable future.",

Although little things like promoting reusable materials instead of trash and more small environmentally friendly businesses are helpful, they are not enough. What we really need to focus on to make a change is big corporations, and forcing the car industry to become more environmentally friendly would make a huge change. I am only moderately in favor of this proposal, however, because I know that financially, it would be very challenging and require a lot of resources to charge the cars.",

To reduce the dependency we have on raw materials whose supply is not assured for example Russian oil being boycotted led to a huge surge in gas prices but if we had electric/renewable power for those cars communities wouldn’t have been as disrupted.<br><br>2. The environment is going through immense degradation due to the drilling for oil and causing long lasting damage to communities eg Niger delta in Nigeria and how even after thirty years they still can’t farm or fish on their land. This harm will only continue as we persist on using oil. <br><br>3. Global Warming is increasing exponentially and action needs to occur to slow it down. Every year we are seeing the devastating tip of the iceberg of the harms we are going to face in the coming years due to the immense heat. My greatest fear is the mutation and adaptation of microbes that could not thrive in human bodies because of our warmth being able to survive in us.",
