Giving teachers guns would decentivize the teachers we actually need in the system and incentivize those who want guns to became teachers. No teacher needs a gun. This only provides more of a threat for children who are already being failed by the system.",

Although I am pro the idea of giving the children and their parents a feeling of safety, having a gun in the classroom is extremely unsafe for the children, and there is no guarantee that the teachers can bar the children from reaching it or even to use it in a moment of frustration.",

People are scared that they have no way to defend themselves or others. Along with mandatory training and education on how/when guns should be used, I think that teachers and school officials should have some way to defend themselves and their students. This is a preventative step in order to save more lives than we would lose and it is sad that we even have to think of this as a possibility.",

I think having guns in the classroom would also create an environment were children don't feel safe. If a teacher needs a gun in the classroom for safety reasons then the children probability need to be scared of some outside threat, but outside threats can be decreased by better security in public schools. Better security meaning metal detecters, a closed perimeter in around every school, and locks on the doors.",
