Americans would be able to breathe cleaner air and also wouldn’t rely on gas(which obviously fluctuates highly in price because of gas corporations’ need for profit). Also there would be uniformity in the types of cars so individuals wouldn’t have to worry about concerns of not being able to access certain services because of what they drive.",

I acknowledge that \"green\" vehicles do not come without their own downsides and won't entirely be the solution to the emission rates of gas vehicles and their impact on their climate. I also don't believe the year 2035 is reasonable for getting all gas vehicles off the market. However, I do believe policy is needed to keep the sustainability of our world flourishing. Baby steps are how we will address preventing any significant changes in our climate. Beginning any form of policy that aims to keep our environmental impact and our industry stable is how we will begin to form a more stable world. It won't happen overnight, but it still needs to happen.",
