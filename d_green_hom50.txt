Think of Amazon and how fast they get your packages to you, if all of those trucks are powered by gas right now they are releasing so many emissions into the atmosphere and have no intention or method of taking them out. Switching to another form of transportation, like electric, would be a preventative measure that would keep these corporations in check.",

Changing the composition of gas-powered cars will allow for a monumental decrease in the amount of fossil fuels emitted from cars and other automobiles. With this change, global climate change will not completely be reversed, but this will certainly help to lessen its effects that are becoming more prominent in the world.",

Climate change will drastically alter the lives of children for decades to come, especially in the developing world but not excluding the United States. Gas-powered cars and trucks directly contribute to the destruction of the natural environment where children, and the adults of the future, can play and explore through carbon emissions. The elimination or limitation of these harmful byproducts will increase the well-being of children around the world, and create a world worth living in.",
