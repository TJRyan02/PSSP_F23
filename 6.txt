	"argument" : "The United States should not invest taxpayers money to subsidize renewable energy. Renewable energy such as solar is not so renewable when you factor that it only produces energy during the day so at night there is no energy produced and then you could have brownouts like California does. Wind power also can produced negative effects such as killing birds that fly into the windmill.<br><br>Even though solar panels do not produce pollutants the manufacturing process in polluting counties like China does provide pollutants as they do not have pollution standards like we do. As a matter of fact \"During the manufacturing of the metallic and plastic parts of the solar panels, there are emissions of harmful gases and other particles that harm the planet. The transportation of the solar components, whether by Land Sea or air results in the emission of greenhouse gases\".<br><br>Wind power also has negative side effects as well. With wind power you obviously need wind. But sometimes you get too much wind when you don't need the extra power and sometimes there is not enough wind to generate power. Wind power also requires a lot of space and is a big eye sore on the property. And like solar panels wind power also has manufacturing pollution as well.<br><br>So the next time you think of solar panels and windmills use your critical thinking skills by thinking of the manufacturing process and the inconsistency of power output. It makes you wonder maybe we should use natural gas as power even though it has pollution output it is the second cleanest burning fuel we could use for power next to nuclear.<br><br>References:<br><br>Naroju, S.
