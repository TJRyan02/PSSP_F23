If we use more electronically powered vehicles, it will help to prevent further damage to the environment like climate change. Climate change is something that even the little things can incredibly help, and this is one that can.",

Although many of us may not feel the impacts yet, we will soon if we continue to produce emissions at this rate. Changes in how cars are powered makes little difference in the use by consumers (especially if subsidies keep the prices similar) yet will have significant, positive, long term effects on our planet and therefore our qualities of life.",

Currently, global warming is impacting cities worldwide, with some coastal cities being submerged underwater, destroying homes and places for people to live. Additionally, the drastic weather changes is also affected by global warming. In our current situation, it's in our best interest to pursue battery-powered cars than continue to emit carbon into the atmosphere.",
