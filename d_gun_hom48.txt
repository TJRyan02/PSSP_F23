Knowing that they have guns would scare me to even slightly tick them off because what if they lose it on me for some reason. I don’t want to die because their coffee wasn’t great today and I asked a “dumb” question",

Imagine all of the issues we have now in our education system: racism, sexism, etc. If a teacher was having a bad day, and believe me I've seen some of my teachers have extremely bad days, what's to stop a psychotic break and let all chaos run loose. Additionally, it is preposterous to place a gun within the grasp of a child, especially those in elementary school. Truly anything could happen and this approach is not even slapping a bandaid over a bullet wound, its an approach that would rip that bullet wound even wider and deeper if implemented.",

Having weapons available in each classroom could lead to more shootings happening in schools as there would be plentiful access to these guns.",

Guns do not belong in schools and the way to prevent gun violenece is not with more guns, but with more laws and policy to end the spread of gun sales.",
