Although many of us may not feel the impacts yet, we will soon if we continue to produce emissions at this rate. Changes in how cars are powered makes little difference in the use by consumers (especially if subsidies keep the prices similar) yet will have significant, positive, long term effects on our planet and therefore our qualities of life.",

Climate change will drastically alter the lives of children for decades to come, especially in the developing world but not excluding the United States. Gas-powered cars and trucks directly contribute to the destruction of the natural environment where children, and the adults of the future, can play and explore through carbon emissions. The elimination or limitation of these harmful byproducts will increase the well-being of children around the world, and create a world worth living in.",

In countries such as Norway, they place heavy taxes on gas and gas powered vehicles allowing people to make their own decisions when buying a car, and not being forced to choose an electric car. I also think that we do not have the infrastructure to support a fully electric car world.",

If the government could incentivize citizens to buy electric cars this would benefit the greater society, while making the resource more accessible.",
