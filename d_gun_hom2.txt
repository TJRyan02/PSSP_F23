While teachers may be trained and own personal weapons I don't think schools are the place for them to bring them. I would rather schools invest in safety measures and potentially allowing SRO's to carry guns.",

Giving teachers guns would decentivize the teachers we actually need in the system and incentivize those who want guns to became teachers. No teacher needs a gun. This only provides more of a threat for children who are already being failed by the system.",

Several teachers recently have had outbursts and come to teach their classes intoxicated which poses a severe threat to the school and students in the classrooms. Guns are one of the most controversial topics and teachers being armed in classrooms may go through bad days which could potentially cost the lives of several students. The mental health crisis specifically proves that several professors are not capable of being armed as they are too affected.",

However, allowing these people specifically to carry small, concealed firearms, for example, can actually serve as a preventative measure in stopping school-related shootings and homicides in and around school areas. I go to a university where there was a recent shooting, and I know for a fact that this shooting could have been thwarted or stopped if officials were allowed to carry firearms. I am certain this could also be the case in K-12 schools, where potentially threatening individuals are more likely to be.",
