Teachers can bring them even if there is a policy stopping them but I think that allowing it could cause more trouble. For example, if a teacher got mad at a student and pulled the gun out in their moment of anger. Itâ€™s overall safer to not have them on school grounds.",

If we already have guns in the schools, the risk may run higher for someone to locate the gun. In my opinion, it does not make schools safe, but arguably unsafer.",

From my experience, it would not be very effective as many teachers would not want to follow through with shooting. I think the real way to solve this issue is to limit gun control, not encourage the use of more guns.",

The amount of gun violence that occurs is absolutely horrible, however, I don't think equipping schools with guns would help to solve that problem. The root of the issue lies within individuals who can access guns in the first place, so I think that should be addressed first.",
