Currently, global warming is impacting cities worldwide, with some coastal cities being submerged underwater, destroying homes and places for people to live. Additionally, the drastic weather changes is also affected by global warming. In our current situation, it's in our best interest to pursue battery-powered cars than continue to emit carbon into the atmosphere.",

Ending gas powered car sales will start the beginning of a greener environment for our country, and eventuallly gas-powered cars will phase out all together",

The alternative to gas-powered cars is likely electric vehicles which are much more expensive in comparison and again, are not inclusive to the socioeconomic demographic in the United States.",

I think it would be more feasible to stop the production of gas-powered cars by 2035, however completely stopping people from selling used cars or newly produced gas-powered cars seems unlikely.",
