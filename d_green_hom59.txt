I think green cars would help the environment and increasing the choices for green cars should be done. But I don't think people should not be allowed to buy gas powered cars.",

One of the major hurdles in this process of slowing the climate crisis is that car companies are not incentivized to produce these cars. If we can show that there is something in it for the car companies, we can take a proactive step into reversing the climate crisis.",
