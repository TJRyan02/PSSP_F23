	"name_arg1" : "I favor the sale of gas-powered cars and trucks ending entirely by 2035 because of carbon emissions. Most carbon emissions come from corporations and they do a lot of travel by land. Think of Amazon and how fast they get your packages to you, if all of those trucks are powered by gas right now they are releasing so many emissions into the atmosphere and have no intention or method of taking them out. Switching to another form of transportation, like electric, would be a preventative measure that would keep these corporations in check.",

It is a small way of contributing to global warming, as at the end of the day the largest contributors are large corporations.",

Additionally, electric/green cars are reported to be easier to operate and safer overall as vehicles. Therefore, not only are they safer for the environment, but are also safer for the driver and act as a means of prevention against crashing.",

	"name_arg4" : "I believe there is lots of good within the argument for green vehicles; however, ending the sales of new gas-powered cars and trucks is not a valid option. Obviously, green vehicles are safer for the environment, but a ban of sales on new gas-powered cars is not fair economically. From the few friends I know that have \"green cars\", it is an expensive endeavor. Banning gas-powered vehicles without proposing a plan to reduce the costs of green vehicles would never pass through legislation, considering most of the legislative wing would hope to represent the larger majority of Americans, who are middle, working, or lower class and probably couldn't afford a mandated switch to green vehicles. <br>In addition, green vehicles require a separate kind of energy-producer (electricity and a charge versus gas at gas stations). Banning gas-powered cars would end up costing millions, if not billions, in replacing gas stations that have less business and in replacing regular parking spots with green vehicle spots with chargers.",
