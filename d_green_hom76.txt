Although little things like promoting reusable materials instead of trash and more small environmentally friendly businesses are helpful, they are not enough. What we really need to focus on to make a change is big corporations, and forcing the car industry to become more environmentally friendly would make a huge change. I am only moderately in favor of this proposal, however, because I know that financially, it would be very challenging and require a lot of resources to charge the cars.",

However, gas cars would still be able to function for a longer amount of time, especially since you can pull gas from other cars and other resources.",
