If this were to happen electric cars would be completely useless. However, gas cars would still be able to function for a longer amount of time, especially since you can pull gas from other cars and other resources.",

I think green cars would help the environment and increasing the choices for green cars should be done. But I don't think people should not be allowed to buy gas powered cars.",

Think of Amazon and how fast they get your packages to you, if all of those trucks are powered by gas right now they are releasing so many emissions into the atmosphere and have no intention or method of taking them out. Switching to another form of transportation, like electric, would be a preventative measure that would keep these corporations in check.",

Humans are constant polluters of the environment, and it starts with the cars and trucks we drive everyday.",
