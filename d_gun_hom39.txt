Guns do not belong in schools and the way to prevent gun violenece is not with more guns, but with more laws and policy to end the spread of gun sales.",

Money spent on purchasing guns can be moved towards education classes towards how to handle mental illness in classrooms and allowing for schools to have protections against guns, like bulletproof glass.",

What benefit would it be for a teacher to have a gun in the classroom, when the students can easily access the gun. There are too many factors for missuse and mistakes that could be very harmful, and it is not worth the risk to introduce guns to the classroom as a means of curbing shootings.",

If we already have guns in the schools, the risk may run higher for someone to locate the gun. In my opinion, it does not make schools safe, but arguably unsafer.",
