The amount of gun violence that occurs is absolutely horrible, however, I don't think equipping schools with guns would help to solve that problem. The root of the issue lies within individuals who can access guns in the first place, so I think that should be addressed first.",

Having weapons available in each classroom could lead to more shootings happening in schools as there would be plentiful access to these guns.",

People are scared that they have no way to defend themselves or others. Along with mandatory training and education on how/when guns should be used, I think that teachers and school officials should have some way to defend themselves and their students. This is a preventative step in order to save more lives than we would lose and it is sad that we even have to think of this as a possibility.",

So instead of fueling fire with fire, we should aim to get to the root of the problem - unregulated access to firearms. With comprehensive gun laws and thorough background checks there would be no other reason why a teacher would need a gun in a K-12 school.",
