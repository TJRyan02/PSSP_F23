	"name_arg1" : "Voluntarily introducing guns into the exact places where guns have ravaged the lives of innocent children is simply counter-intuitive. Just as drugs, fights, and classroom disruptions have no place in a learning environment, weapons do not either. Furthermore, imagine being 5-years-old, entering your Kindergarten classroom for the first time, and seeing a pistol holstered on your smiling teachers hip. It's dystopian. Children are taught from a very young age to understand that guns mean violence. The purpose of a gun is to kill. Why bring this threat to children in the classroom?",

While some argue it could aid in defense, the root of the problem should be addressed instead of trying to combat. Teachers should not have to defend their students from mass-shooting threats. Instead, the cause of these school shootings needs to be investigated and prevented.",

No amount of training would justify having teachers carry guns, and bringing guns into classrooms and schools would make them less safe. Instead of arming teachers why canâ€™t we increase mental health resources and gun control for minors.",

If we already have guns in the schools, the risk may run higher for someone to locate the gun. In my opinion, it does not make schools safe, but arguably unsafer.",
