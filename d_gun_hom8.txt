While some argue it could aid in defense, the root of the problem should be addressed instead of trying to combat. Teachers should not have to defend their students from mass-shooting threats. Instead, the cause of these school shootings needs to be investigated and prevented.",

Most teachers would not be able to stop an aggressive student attempting to take their gun. I think guns on campus would not raise safety but raise paranoia. Teachers are not trained to be professionals with firearms, and they shouldn't have to be.",

Teachers would need extensive, expensive firearm training to be allowed to wield weapons around literal children. <br>Firearms should inherently not be around kids.

The amount of gun violence that occurs is absolutely horrible, however, I don't think equipping schools with guns would help to solve that problem. The root of the issue lies within individuals who can access guns in the first place, so I think that should be addressed first.",
