The primary responsibility of teachers is to educate and create a safe learning environment for students. Introducing firearms into schools could increase the chances of accidents, misuse, or escalation of violence. It is important to focus on implementing effective school safety measures, such as improved security protocols and mental health support, to ensure the well-being of students and staff.",

Using guns in general as the main antithesis of gun violence in schools is absurd. <br>Accidents would increase. Consequentially... <br>Cost of training would also need to be considered (it often is not). Teachers would need extensive, expensive firearm training to be allowed to wield weapons around literal children. <br>Firearms should inherently not be around kids. Giving teachers guns would be a slap in the face of child safety concerns.",

	"name_arg3" : "I strongly oppose allowing teachers and school officials to carry guns in K-12 schools for several compelling reasons. Mainly, the primary role of educators and school staff is to provide a safe and nurturing learning environment for students. Introducing firearms into this equation poses the risk of accidents, confusion, and undue stress on educators who should focus on teaching. Moreover, arming teachers can have adverse psychological effects on students, making them feel unsafe and potentially damaging the teacher-student relationship, which should be built on trust and mentorship rather than fear. Law enforcement and security personnel are better equipped to handle potentially dangerous situations, and investing in professional security measures and mental health support for students and staff is a more effective and responsible approach to ensuring school safety. This way, we can maintain the sanctity of our educational environments while addressing safety concerns through the appropriate channels.",

Money spent on purchasing guns can be moved towards education classes towards how to handle mental illness in classrooms and allowing for schools to have protections against guns, like bulletproof glass.",
