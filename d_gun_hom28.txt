Guns do not belong in schools and the way to prevent gun violenece is not with more guns, but with more laws and policy to end the spread of gun sales.",

Guns aren't allowed in their government buildings or their offices, so why are they trying to put this burden on teachers? I think if you want to increase security, increasing law enforcement personnel on campus could be a start. Additionally, I am in favor of stricter gun laws that would force consumers to jump through more hoops to purchase a firearm. I'm not a proponent of banning guns, don't get it twisted. However, I think we could be doing more in the legislature to prevent gun violence.",

	"name_arg4" : "Opposing the idea of allowing teachers and school officials to carry guns in K-12 schools is rooted in a commitment to the safety and well-being of students and the belief that alternative solutions are more effective and less risky. First and foremost, introducing firearms into educational environments increases the potential for accidents and unintended harm. Teachers are primarily trained to educate, not to handle life-threatening situations, and arming them could lead to unintentional firearm discharges, endangering both students and educators.<br><br>Furthermore, the presence of guns in schools may create an atmosphere of fear and anxiety among students. Learning is most effective in a safe and nurturing environment, and the introduction of firearms can undermine this atmosphere, potentially causing emotional distress and hindering the educational experience.<br><br>Advocates for arming teachers argue that it could deter potential shooters, but evidence suggests otherwise. In high-stress situations, even trained professionals sometimes make critical errors, and expecting educators to serve as the first line of defense against armed attackers is unrealistic and unfair. It could place undue stress on teachers, affecting their ability to teach effectively.<br><br>A better approach to school safety is investing in comprehensive measures such as improved mental health support, enhanced security infrastructure, and stricter gun control laws. These solutions address the root causes of school violence and provide a safer and more sustainable path to protecting our students.",
