	"name_arg1" : "Having armed teachers in schools is likely one of the most dangerous things that could happen. If teachers are allowed access to weaponry without the necessary safety protocols to go along with them, these teachers are becoming equally as dangerous as anyone they'd be protecting from. Also, this puts very dangerous weaponry in very close proximity to the children being taught. This could put students at risk if other students decide to take advantage of the weapons and create chaos.",

Most teachers would not be able to stop an aggressive student attempting to take their gun. I think guns on campus would not raise safety but raise paranoia. Teachers are not trained to be professionals with firearms, and they shouldn't have to be.",

So instead of fueling fire with fire, we should aim to get to the root of the problem - unregulated access to firearms.
