Additionally, electric/green cars are reported to be easier to operate and safer overall as vehicles. Therefore, not only are they safer for the environment, but are also safer for the driver and act as a means of prevention against crashing.",

The average EV in an average scenario costs about half as much to drive per mile as does an average gas car in an average scenario. So not only is it more environmentally friendly, it is economically efficient. It is a win-win if we were to get rid of gas cars and switched completely to EVs. Especially considering the level of technology in current EVs, they are only going to get more efficient in the future.",

Decreasing the number of gas powered vehicles on the road would be an important step toward lowering carbon emissions, which is an important consideration for the future of our country.",

Gas prices are entirely too highly volatile and leave most Americans scrambling with a sudden rise. Additionally, by eliminating their sale, we will be able to move forward together towards a cleaner, more green future. In response to those who disagree with this opinion, I understand your apprehension but encourage you to think about the planet you want to leave your children with. At the current state we're going, your children may never know what it's like to breathe outside without a oxygen mask or remember the trees due to the concerns of CO2 production and the ozone layer.",
