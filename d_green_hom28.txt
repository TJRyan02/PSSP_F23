To reduce the dependency we have on raw materials whose supply is not assured for example Russian oil being boycotted led to a huge surge in gas prices but if we had electric/renewable power for those cars communities wouldn’t have been as disrupted.<br><br>2. The environment is going through immense degradation due to the drilling for oil and causing long lasting damage to communities eg Niger delta in Nigeria and how even after thirty years they still can’t farm or fish on their land. This harm will only continue as we persist on using oil. <br><br>3. Global Warming is increasing exponentially and action needs to occur to slow it down. Every year we are seeing the devastating tip of the iceberg of the harms we are going to face in the coming years due to the immense heat. My greatest fear is the mutation and adaptation of microbes that could not thrive in human bodies because of our warmth being able to survive in us.",

Currently, global warming is impacting cities worldwide, with some coastal cities being submerged underwater, destroying homes and places for people to live. Additionally, the drastic weather changes is also affected by global warming. In our current situation, it's in our best interest to pursue battery-powered cars than continue to emit carbon into the atmosphere.",

It would limit the amount of carbon pollution in the air, leading to the destruction of the ozone layer, and thus allow the earth to remain protected for future generations. Also, electric cars are a new business. It would increase the U.S. economy and allow for new jobs to emerge as these cars become more widespread in popularity.",
