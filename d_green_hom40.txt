Although many of us may not feel the impacts yet, we will soon if we continue to produce emissions at this rate. Changes in how cars are powered makes little difference in the use by consumers (especially if subsidies keep the prices similar) yet will have significant, positive, long term effects on our planet and therefore our qualities of life.",

As we all know, climate change is very real and very apparent with temperatures increasing more and more each year. Although some may argue that it is too far gone for us to make a difference, I do think it is still important to try and reduce how fast climate change is happening. The proposal could be similar to Obama's CARS (Car Allowance Rebate System), which would make it easier for Americans to afford the new cars if price is an issue. For the most part, Obama's program was successful, so I believe the new proposal should also go relatively smoothly.",
