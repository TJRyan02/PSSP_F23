I feel that many educators do not adequately no how to properly use a gun and this policy would ultimately make the situation more dangerous than it already is. Instead, our government needs to focus on taking guns away from those who shouldnâ€™t have them and putting the necessary protections in place to stop dangerous people from getting a gun.",

Teachers are not trained to be professionals with firearms, and they shouldn't have to be.",
