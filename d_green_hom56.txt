Changing the composition of gas-powered cars will allow for a monumental decrease in the amount of fossil fuels emitted from cars and other automobiles. With this change, global climate change will not completely be reversed, but this will certainly help to lessen its effects that are becoming more prominent in the world.",

One of the major hurdles in this process of slowing the climate crisis is that car companies are not incentivized to produce these cars. If we can show that there is something in it for the car companies, we can take a proactive step into reversing the climate crisis.",
