The process of obtaining the power for electric vehicles is highly destructive and often violates many human rights in the process. Instead, we should focus on increasing and improving public transit systems and city infrastructure.",

Americans would be able to breathe cleaner air and also wouldn’t rely on gas(which obviously fluctuates highly in price because of gas corporations’ need for profit). Also there would be uniformity in the types of cars so individuals wouldn’t have to worry about concerns of not being able to access certain services because of what they drive.",

Transitioning to electric vehicles can help decrease carbon emissions and improve air quality. Additionally, advancements in electric vehicle technology have made them more accessible and practical for everyday use. The shift towards electric vehicles also promotes innovation and investment in renewable energy sources. Ultimately, the goal is to create a more sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation system.",

Think of Amazon and how fast they get your packages to you, if all of those trucks are powered by gas right now they are releasing so many emissions into the atmosphere and have no intention or method of taking them out. Switching to another form of transportation, like electric, would be a preventative measure that would keep these corporations in check.",
