In my view, the only effective way of stopping school shootings is by limiting the number of guns throughout society. That is, through gun control.",

If teachers are allowed access to weaponry without the necessary safety protocols to go along with them, these teachers are becoming equally as dangerous as anyone they'd be protecting from. Also, this puts very dangerous weaponry in very close proximity to the children being taught. This could put students at risk if other students decide to take advantage of the weapons and create chaos.",

What benefit would it be for a teacher to have a gun in the classroom, when the students can easily access the gun. There are too many factors for missuse and mistakes that could be very harmful, and it is not worth the risk to introduce guns to the classroom as a means of curbing shootings.",

Furthermore, guns should not be allowed at school even as a \"means of protection\" as they ultimately will create more harm than good even in the event of an emergency. It also brings about the idea that students could potentially look to steal the guns and provides another route of access for people who should not be in possession of guns to acquire them.",
