We shouldn't have to debate whether or not to arm teachers. If teachers had access to guns, imagine how dangerous it would be if an angry/uneducated student got a hold of the gun. It would be an even larger issue. The government needs to focus on gun control before they equip teachers with guns.",

What benefit would it be for a teacher to have a gun in the classroom, when the students can easily access the gun. There are too many factors for missuse and mistakes that could be very harmful, and it is not worth the risk to introduce guns to the classroom as a means of curbing shootings.",

If we already have guns in the schools, the risk may run higher for someone to locate the gun. In my opinion, it does not make schools safe, but arguably unsafer.",
