While teachers may be trained and own personal weapons I don't think schools are the place for them to bring them. I would rather schools invest in safety measures and potentially allowing SRO's to carry guns.",

Having a school shooter come to your school is not going to be fixed by another person in the building also having a gun more guns don't stop the shooting they just make it worse and endanger more people. Also, in order for this to happen every teacher and staff would need to have formal gun training and safety so that they knew what they were doing and did not let a kid get a hold of it and that would be really expensive. Adding more guns will just scare more people, scare more kids.",
