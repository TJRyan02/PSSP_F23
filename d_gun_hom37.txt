Although I am pro the idea of giving the children and their parents a feeling of safety, having a gun in the classroom is extremely unsafe for the children, and there is no guarantee that the teachers can bar the children from reaching it or even to use it in a moment of frustration.",

	"name_arg2" : "Many people argue over gun control of whether it needs to be strengthened or not. In my personal opinion, it needs to be strengthened. Guns have no right to be on a school's campus. We shouldn't have to debate whether or not to arm teachers. If teachers had access to guns, imagine how dangerous it would be if an angry/uneducated student got a hold of the gun. It would be an even larger issue. The government needs to focus on gun control before they equip teachers with guns.",

While teachers may be trained and own personal weapons I don't think schools are the place for them to bring them. I would rather schools invest in safety measures and potentially allowing SRO's to carry guns.",

	"name_arg4" : "I strongly oppose allowing teachers and school officials to carry guns in K-12 schools for several compelling reasons. Mainly, the primary role of educators and school staff is to provide a safe and nurturing learning environment for students. Introducing firearms into this equation poses the risk of accidents, confusion, and undue stress on educators who should focus on teaching. Moreover, arming teachers can have adverse psychological effects on students, making them feel unsafe and potentially damaging the teacher-student relationship, which should be built on trust and mentorship rather than fear. Law enforcement and security personnel are better equipped to handle potentially dangerous situations, and investing in professional security measures and mental health support for students and staff is a more effective and responsible approach to ensuring school safety. This way, we can maintain the sanctity of our educational environments while addressing safety concerns through the appropriate channels.",
