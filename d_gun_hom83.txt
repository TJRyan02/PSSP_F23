I think having guns in the classroom would also create an environment were children don't feel safe. If a teacher needs a gun in the classroom for safety reasons then the children probability need to be scared of some outside threat, but outside threats can be decreased by better security in public schools. Better security meaning metal detecters, a closed perimeter in around every school, and locks on the doors.",

Most teachers would not be able to stop an aggressive student attempting to take their gun. I think guns on campus would not raise safety but raise paranoia. Teachers are not trained to be professionals with firearms, and they shouldn't have to be.",

Furthermore, guns should not be allowed at school even as a \"means of protection\" as they ultimately will create more harm than good even in the event of an emergency. It also brings about the idea that students could potentially look to steal the guns and provides another route of access for people who should not be in possession of guns to acquire them.",

If we already have guns in the schools, the risk may run higher for someone to locate the gun. In my opinion, it does not make schools safe, but arguably unsafer.",
