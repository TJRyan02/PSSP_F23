	"name_arg1" : "I favor allowing teachers and school officials to carry guns in K-12 schools because there are school shootings happening all around the country. People are scared that they have no way to defend themselves or others. Along with mandatory training and education on how/when guns should be used, I think that teachers and school officials should have some way to defend themselves and their students. This is a preventative step in order to save more lives than we would lose and it is sad that we even have to think of this as a possibility.",

The money that could be used to buy a gun for each teacher and train them on how to use them could instead be used on security measures to protect a school from potential attackers.",

Furthermore, guns should not be allowed at school even as a \"means of protection\" as they ultimately will create more harm than good even in the event of an emergency. It also brings about the idea that students could potentially look to steal the guns and provides another route of access for people who should not be in possession of guns to acquire them.",

While teachers may be trained and own personal weapons I don't think schools are the place for them to bring them. I would rather schools invest in safety measures and potentially allowing SRO's to carry guns.",
