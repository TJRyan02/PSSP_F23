One way that we can do this is switching from gasoline powered vehicles to electrically powered cars. Offering government issued incentives to car dealerships to switch to electrically powered vehicles increases the likelihood that dealerships will want to make the switch. Making small changes to our everyday life, like switching the way we power our cars, homes, and buildings is just one way that we can ensure a safe, clean, and prosperous future for generations to come.",

Climate change will drastically alter the lives of children for decades to come, especially in the developing world but not excluding the United States. Gas-powered cars and trucks directly contribute to the destruction of the natural environment where children, and the adults of the future, can play and explore through carbon emissions. The elimination or limitation of these harmful byproducts will increase the well-being of children around the world, and create a world worth living in.",

To reduce the dependency we have on raw materials whose supply is not assured for example Russian oil being boycotted led to a huge surge in gas prices but if we had electric/renewable power for those cars communities wouldn’t have been as disrupted.<br><br>2. The environment is going through immense degradation due to the drilling for oil and causing long lasting damage to communities eg Niger delta in Nigeria and how even after thirty years they still can’t farm or fish on their land. This harm will only continue as we persist on using oil. <br><br>3. Global Warming is increasing exponentially and action needs to occur to slow it down. Every year we are seeing the devastating tip of the iceberg of the harms we are going to face in the coming years due to the immense heat. My greatest fear is the mutation and adaptation of microbes that could not thrive in human bodies because of our warmth being able to survive in us.",

This is a crucial step in addressing climate change, as the transportation sector is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. By promoting electric vehicles (EVs), we can significantly reduce carbon emissions, aligning with global efforts to combat climate change and limit temperature rise.<br><br>The transition to electric vehicles also presents economic opportunities. It can stimulate innovation, create jobs in the clean energy sector, and position the United States as a leader in the EV industry. The public health benefits are also significant, as it will lead to improved air quality, reducing health issues caused by vehicle emissions.<br><br>Ending the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035 is an approach that addresses climate change, fosters economic growth, and improves public health.",
