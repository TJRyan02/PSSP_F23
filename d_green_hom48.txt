	"name_arg1" : "I favor the proposal for ending gas-powered cars by 2035 mainly because it would help the environment. As we all know, climate change is very real and very apparent with temperatures increasing more and more each year. Although some may argue that it is too far gone for us to make a difference, I do think it is still important to try and reduce how fast climate change is happening. The proposal could be similar to Obama's CARS (Car Allowance Rebate System), which would make it easier for Americans to afford the new cars if price is an issue. For the most part, Obama's program was successful, so I believe the new proposal should also go relatively smoothly.",

The alternative to gas-powered cars is likely electric vehicles which are much more expensive in comparison and again, are not inclusive to the socioeconomic demographic in the United States.",

Each vehicle would already be electric-based.",
