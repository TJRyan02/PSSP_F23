I favor this because I think the health of our environment should be considered extremely important and a very high priority at this point in time because of the damage that has already been done. I think that shifting from gas powered cars to electric cars is a shift that does not really negatively effect anyone so therefore it is a good place to start mending the damage done to the environment.",

In countries such as Norway, they place heavy taxes on gas and gas powered vehicles allowing people to make their own decisions when buying a car, and not being forced to choose an electric car. I also think that we do not have the infrastructure to support a fully electric car world.",
