I think the actual issue is keep shooters out and not focusing on what to do when they get in. I think there should be a stronger police presence on school campuses through SRO's because they have the necessary training with guns and active shooter situations. I do not think that it is appropriate for teachers to casually have guns in classrooms but that is not to say that I do not think that something must be done to prevent school shootings. I just don't think teachers having guns is the answer.",

	"name_arg3" : "Many people argue over gun control of whether it needs to be strengthened or not. In my personal opinion, it needs to be strengthened. Guns have no right to be on a school's campus. We shouldn't have to debate whether or not to arm teachers. If teachers had access to guns, imagine how dangerous it would be if an angry/uneducated student got a hold of the gun. It would be an even larger issue. The government needs to focus on gun control before they equip teachers with guns.",

Guns aren't allowed in their government buildings or their offices, so why are they trying to put this burden on teachers? I think if you want to increase security, increasing law enforcement personnel on campus could be a start. Additionally, I am in favor of stricter gun laws that would force consumers to jump through more hoops to purchase a firearm. I'm not a proponent of banning guns, don't get it twisted. However, I think we could be doing more in the legislature to prevent gun violence.",
