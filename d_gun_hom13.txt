So instead of fueling fire with fire, we should aim to get to the root of the problem - unregulated access to firearms. With comprehensive gun laws and thorough background checks there would be no other reason why a teacher would need a gun in a K-12 school.",

However, allowing these people specifically to carry small, concealed firearms, for example, can actually serve as a preventative measure in stopping school-related shootings and homicides in and around school areas. I go to a university where there was a recent shooting, and I know for a fact that this shooting could have been thwarted or stopped if officials were allowed to carry firearms. I am certain this could also be the case in K-12 schools, where potentially threatening individuals are more likely to be.",

No amount of training would justify having teachers carry guns, and bringing guns into classrooms and schools would make them less safe. Instead of arming teachers why canâ€™t we increase mental health resources and gun control for minors.",

If we already have guns in the schools, the risk may run higher for someone to locate the gun. In my opinion, it does not make schools safe, but arguably unsafer.",
