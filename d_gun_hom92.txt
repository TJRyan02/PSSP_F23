I think having guns in the classroom would also create an environment were children don't feel safe. If a teacher needs a gun in the classroom for safety reasons then the children probability need to be scared of some outside threat, but outside threats can be decreased by better security in public schools. Better security meaning metal detecters, a closed perimeter in around every school, and locks on the doors.",

We should be focusing more on removing the threat of guns entirely by introducing stricter gun regulation and education in schools. Having guns in school also poses a danger, if a child was to gain access it.",

However, the root of the issue is that people have access to guns in the first place. The focus on solving the mass shootings in America shouldn't be on arming people to protect themselves, but to limit the amount of people that are allowed to carry guns to begin with.",
