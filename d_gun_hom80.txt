Guns do not belong in schools and the way to prevent gun violenece is not with more guns, but with more laws and policy to end the spread of gun sales.",

Due to lack of education on weapons, even individuals with safe usage lack the ability to safely use and store a gun. In light of recent events, I feel as the issue isn't necesarrily guns its a mental health issue. I feel as if teachers or anyone in generally would have to go through extensive screening to be able to do so.",

No amount of training would justify having teachers carry guns, and bringing guns into classrooms and schools would make them less safe. Instead of arming teachers why canâ€™t we increase mental health resources and gun control for minors.",

Money spent on purchasing guns can be moved towards education classes towards how to handle mental illness in classrooms and allowing for schools to have protections against guns, like bulletproof glass.",
