Teachers can bring them even if there is a policy stopping them but I think that allowing it could cause more trouble. For example, if a teacher got mad at a student and pulled the gun out in their moment of anger. Itâ€™s overall safer to not have them on school grounds.",

What if a child gets a hold of the gun and starts shooting not only the teachers but the students as well. Furthermore, this can cause students to be scared to be at school or make it seem that it is normal for people to carry guns to school.",

Firing a gun at a threat is outside the scope of what a teacher signs up for. Possessing a gun around numerous minors adds another level of pressure onto teachers and faculty. What if a student were to steal the firearm, the teacher or faculty member would most likely be assumed reliable for the theft.",
