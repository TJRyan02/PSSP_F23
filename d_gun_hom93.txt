The primary responsibility of teachers is to educate and create a safe learning environment for students. Introducing firearms into schools could increase the chances of accidents, misuse, or escalation of violence. It is important to focus on implementing effective school safety measures, such as improved security protocols and mental health support, to ensure the well-being of students and staff.",

Having guns in the classroom would only leave the possibility for incidents involving these guns open, which is the opposite goal of everyone. Schools should be a place to foster learning and creativity, and having guns in the classroom would likely make many students and teachers nervous, and intensive training would also be required to ensure that teachers and school officials were well-trained on how to use the weapons.",

Just as drugs, fights, and classroom disruptions have no place in a learning environment, weapons do not either. Furthermore, imagine being 5-years-old, entering your Kindergarten classroom for the first time, and seeing a pistol holstered on your smiling teachers hip. It's dystopian. Children are taught from a very young age to understand that guns mean violence. The purpose of a gun is to kill. Why bring this threat to children in the classroom?",
