Having weapons available in each classroom could lead to more shootings happening in schools as there would be plentiful access to these guns.",

Imagine all of the issues we have now in our education system: racism, sexism, etc. If a teacher was having a bad day, and believe me I've seen some of my teachers have extremely bad days, what's to stop a psychotic break and let all chaos run loose. Additionally, it is preposterous to place a gun within the grasp of a child, especially those in elementary school. Truly anything could happen and this approach is not even slapping a bandaid over a bullet wound, its an approach that would rip that bullet wound even wider and deeper if implemented.",

How many videos are seen these days of teachers and students getting into physical altercations. Now imagine if their was a gun within reaching distance. You can look at road rage circumstances for example, small altercations quickly blow up into shots being fired. Teachers and students are simply too emotionally involved to have access to such a weapon",

We should be focusing more on removing the threat of guns entirely by introducing stricter gun regulation and education in schools. Having guns in school also poses a danger, if a child was to gain access it.",
