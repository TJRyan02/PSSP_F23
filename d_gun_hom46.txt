If we already have guns in the schools, the risk may run higher for someone to locate the gun. In my opinion, it does not make schools safe, but arguably unsafer.",

Although I am pro the idea of giving the children and their parents a feeling of safety, having a gun in the classroom is extremely unsafe for the children, and there is no guarantee that the teachers can bar the children from reaching it or even to use it in a moment of frustration.",

Furthermore, guns should not be allowed at school even as a \"means of protection\" as they ultimately will create more harm than good even in the event of an emergency. It also brings about the idea that students could potentially look to steal the guns and provides another route of access for people who should not be in possession of guns to acquire them.",

However, the root of the issue is that people have access to guns in the first place. The focus on solving the mass shootings in America shouldn't be on arming people to protect themselves, but to limit the amount of people that are allowed to carry guns to begin with.",
