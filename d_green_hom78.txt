If the government could incentivize citizens to buy electric cars this would benefit the greater society, while making the resource more accessible.",

I favor this because I think the health of our environment should be considered extremely important and a very high priority at this point in time because of the damage that has already been done. I think that shifting from gas powered cars to electric cars is a shift that does not really negatively effect anyone so therefore it is a good place to start mending the damage done to the environment.",

I think green cars would help the environment and increasing the choices for green cars should be done. But I don't think people should not be allowed to buy gas powered cars.",
