It would limit the amount of carbon pollution in the air, leading to the destruction of the ozone layer, and thus allow the earth to remain protected for future generations. Also, electric cars are a new business. It would increase the U.S. economy and allow for new jobs to emerge as these cars become more widespread in popularity.",

If this were to happen electric cars would be completely useless. However, gas cars would still be able to function for a longer amount of time, especially since you can pull gas from other cars and other resources.",
