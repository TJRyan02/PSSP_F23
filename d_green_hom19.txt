One of the major hurdles in this process of slowing the climate crisis is that car companies are not incentivized to produce these cars. If we can show that there is something in it for the car companies, we can take a proactive step into reversing the climate crisis.",

The transition would be to abrupt and \"gas-powered\" vehicles can include hybrid vehicles, which have reduced emissions. Instead, I feel the movement away from gas should be more gradual, addressing the climate problem without strongly affecting industry.",

Although little things like promoting reusable materials instead of trash and more small environmentally friendly businesses are helpful, they are not enough. What we really need to focus on to make a change is big corporations, and forcing the car industry to become more environmentally friendly would make a huge change. I am only moderately in favor of this proposal, however, because I know that financially, it would be very challenging and require a lot of resources to charge the cars.",
