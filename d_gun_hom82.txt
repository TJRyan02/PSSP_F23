	"name_arg1" : "Teachers and school officials should not be given the responsibility of possessing guns with the intention of defense if a threat should impose on campus. Firing a gun at a threat is outside the scope of what a teacher signs up for. Possessing a gun around numerous minors adds another level of pressure onto teachers and faculty. What if a student were to steal the firearm, the teacher or faculty member would most likely be assumed reliable for the theft.",

We should be focusing more on removing the threat of guns entirely by introducing stricter gun regulation and education in schools. Having guns in school also poses a danger, if a child was to gain access it.",

Using guns in general as the main antithesis of gun violence in schools is absurd. <br>Accidents would increase. Consequentially... <br>Cost of training would also need to be considered (it often is not). Teachers would need extensive, expensive firearm training to be allowed to wield weapons around literal children. <br>Firearms should inherently not be around kids. Giving teachers guns would be a slap in the face of child safety concerns.",

	"name_arg4" : "I would truly like to understand more about the training teachers undergo when carrying an armed weapon on campus. Several teachers recently have had outbursts and come to teach their classes intoxicated which poses a severe threat to the school and students in the classrooms. Guns are one of the most controversial topics and teachers being armed in classrooms may go through bad days which could potentially cost the lives of several students. The mental health crisis specifically proves that several professors are not capable of being armed as they are too affected.",
