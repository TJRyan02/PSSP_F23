One way that we can do this is switching from gasoline powered vehicles to electrically powered cars. Offering government issued incentives to car dealerships to switch to electrically powered vehicles increases the likelihood that dealerships will want to make the switch. Making small changes to our everyday life, like switching the way we power our cars, homes, and buildings is just one way that we can ensure a safe, clean, and prosperous future for generations to come.",

Decreasing the number of gas powered vehicles on the road would be an important step toward lowering carbon emissions, which is an important consideration for the future of our country.",

Currently, global warming is impacting cities worldwide, with some coastal cities being submerged underwater, destroying homes and places for people to live. Additionally, the drastic weather changes is also affected by global warming. In our current situation, it's in our best interest to pursue battery-powered cars than continue to emit carbon into the atmosphere.",

The first issue it would aid is global warming, as electric cars are probably better for the environment. Second, this would solve the issue of the gas shortage, which is making gas prices sour. Additionally, gas is a natural resource that frequently cases issues between countries, so this could bring some peace to that.",
