Although many of us may not feel the impacts yet, we will soon if we continue to produce emissions at this rate. Changes in how cars are powered makes little difference in the use by consumers (especially if subsidies keep the prices similar) yet will have significant, positive, long term effects on our planet and therefore our qualities of life.",

Unless there's a proper system for finances set up for individuals in that category, I don't think it would be the most efficient policy.",

Gas prices are entirely too highly volatile and leave most Americans scrambling with a sudden rise. Additionally, by eliminating their sale, we will be able to move forward together towards a cleaner, more green future. In response to those who disagree with this opinion, I understand your apprehension but encourage you to think about the planet you want to leave your children with. At the current state we're going, your children may never know what it's like to breathe outside without a oxygen mask or remember the trees due to the concerns of CO2 production and the ozone layer.",

If the government could incentivize citizens to buy electric cars this would benefit the greater society, while making the resource more accessible.",
