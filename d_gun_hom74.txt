Having guns in the classroom would only leave the possibility for incidents involving these guns open, which is the opposite goal of everyone. Schools should be a place to foster learning and creativity, and having guns in the classroom would likely make many students and teachers nervous, and intensive training would also be required to ensure that teachers and school officials were well-trained on how to use the weapons.",

Several teachers recently have had outbursts and come to teach their classes intoxicated which poses a severe threat to the school and students in the classrooms. Guns are one of the most controversial topics and teachers being armed in classrooms may go through bad days which could potentially cost the lives of several students. The mental health crisis specifically proves that several professors are not capable of being armed as they are too affected.",
