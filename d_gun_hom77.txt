I believe that guns should not be as easily accessible, and a school is certainly not a place for such a dangerous and life-threatening weapon.",

Teachers can bring them even if there is a policy stopping them but I think that allowing it could cause more trouble. For example, if a teacher got mad at a student and pulled the gun out in their moment of anger. Itâ€™s overall safer to not have them on school grounds.",

People are scared that they have no way to defend themselves or others. Along with mandatory training and education on how/when guns should be used, I think that teachers and school officials should have some way to defend themselves and their students. This is a preventative step in order to save more lives than we would lose and it is sad that we even have to think of this as a possibility.",

Guns aren't allowed in their government buildings or their offices, so why are they trying to put this burden on teachers? I think if you want to increase security, increasing law enforcement personnel on campus could be a start. Additionally, I am in favor of stricter gun laws that would force consumers to jump through more hoops to purchase a firearm. I'm not a proponent of banning guns, don't get it twisted. However, I think we could be doing more in the legislature to prevent gun violence.",
