	"name_arg1" : "I oppose allowing teachers and school officials to carry guns in K - 12 schools because I think the presence of guns will instill fear among students. I think the actual issue is keep shooters out and not focusing on what to do when they get in. I think there should be a stronger police presence on school campuses through SRO's because they have the necessary training with guns and active shooter situations. I do not think that it is appropriate for teachers to casually have guns in classrooms but that is not to say that I do not think that something must be done to prevent school shootings. I just don't think teachers having guns is the answer.",

I believe that guns should not be as easily accessible, and a school is certainly not a place for such a dangerous and life-threatening weapon.",

So instead of fueling fire with fire, we should aim to get to the root of the problem - unregulated access to firearms. With comprehensive gun laws and thorough background checks there would be no other reason why a teacher would need a gun in a K-12 school.",

Having a school shooter come to your school is not going to be fixed by another person in the building also having a gun more guns don't stop the shooting they just make it worse and endanger more people. Also, in order for this to happen every teacher and staff would need to have formal gun training and safety so that they knew what they were doing and did not let a kid get a hold of it and that would be really expensive. Adding more guns will just scare more people, scare more kids.",
