Although I am pro the idea of giving the children and their parents a feeling of safety, having a gun in the classroom is extremely unsafe for the children, and there is no guarantee that the teachers can bar the children from reaching it or even to use it in a moment of frustration.",

Money spent on purchasing guns can be moved towards education classes towards how to handle mental illness in classrooms and allowing for schools to have protections against guns, like bulletproof glass.",

Instead of arming teachers why canâ€™t we increase mental health resources and gun control for minors.",
