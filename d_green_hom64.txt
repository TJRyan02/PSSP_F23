The average EV in an average scenario costs about half as much to drive per mile as does an average gas car in an average scenario. So not only is it more environmentally friendly, it is economically efficient. It is a win-win if we were to get rid of gas cars and switched completely to EVs. Especially considering the level of technology in current EVs, they are only going to get more efficient in the future.",

One of the major hurdles in this process of slowing the climate crisis is that car companies are not incentivized to produce these cars. If we can show that there is something in it for the car companies, we can take a proactive step into reversing the climate crisis.",
