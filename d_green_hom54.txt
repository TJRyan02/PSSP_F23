	"name_arg1" : "I believe that the sale of new gas-powered cars and trucks should end by 2035 due to a plethora of economic and environmental reasons. Gas prices are entirely too highly volatile and leave most Americans scrambling with a sudden rise. Additionally, by eliminating their sale, we will be able to move forward together towards a cleaner, more green future. In response to those who disagree with this opinion, I understand your apprehension but encourage you to think about the planet you want to leave your children with. At the current state we're going, your children may never know what it's like to breathe outside without a oxygen mask or remember the trees due to the concerns of CO2 production and the ozone layer.",

Think of Amazon and how fast they get your packages to you, if all of those trucks are powered by gas right now they are releasing so many emissions into the atmosphere and have no intention or method of taking them out. Switching to another form of transportation, like electric, would be a preventative measure that would keep these corporations in check.",
