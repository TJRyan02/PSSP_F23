I think having guns in the classroom would also create an environment were children don't feel safe. If a teacher needs a gun in the classroom for safety reasons then the children probability need to be scared of some outside threat, but outside threats can be decreased by better security in public schools. Better security meaning metal detecters, a closed perimeter in around every school, and locks on the doors.",

We should be focusing more on removing the threat of guns entirely by introducing stricter gun regulation and education in schools. Having guns in school also poses a danger, if a child was to gain access it.",

We shouldn't have to debate whether or not to arm teachers. If teachers had access to guns, imagine how dangerous it would be if an angry/uneducated student got a hold of the gun. It would be an even larger issue. The government needs to focus on gun control before they equip teachers with guns.",
