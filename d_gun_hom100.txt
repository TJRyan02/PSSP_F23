It is also possible that there will be attempts from students to take these guns to scare and possibly even injure fellow students. Schools are already a volatile environment, and introducing more guns is unlikely to ameliorate this situation.",

	"name_arg2" : "Many people argue over gun control of whether it needs to be strengthened or not. In my personal opinion, it needs to be strengthened. Guns have no right to be on a school's campus. We shouldn't have to debate whether or not to arm teachers. If teachers had access to guns, imagine how dangerous it would be if an angry/uneducated student got a hold of the gun. It would be an even larger issue. The government needs to focus on gun control before they equip teachers with guns.",

Having a school shooter come to your school is not going to be fixed by another person in the building also having a gun more guns don't stop the shooting they just make it worse and endanger more people. Also, in order for this to happen every teacher and staff would need to have formal gun training and safety so that they knew what they were doing and did not let a kid get a hold of it and that would be really expensive. Adding more guns will just scare more people, scare more kids.",

	"name_arg4" : "I would truly like to understand more about the training teachers undergo when carrying an armed weapon on campus. Several teachers recently have had outbursts and come to teach their classes intoxicated which poses a severe threat to the school and students in the classrooms. Guns are one of the most controversial topics and teachers being armed in classrooms may go through bad days which could potentially cost the lives of several students. The mental health crisis specifically proves that several professors are not capable of being armed as they are too affected.",
