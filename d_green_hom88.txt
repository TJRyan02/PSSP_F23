Additionally, electric/green cars are reported to be easier to operate and safer overall as vehicles. Therefore, not only are they safer for the environment, but are also safer for the driver and act as a means of prevention against crashing.",

The transition would be to abrupt and \"gas-powered\" vehicles can include hybrid vehicles, which have reduced emissions.

Gas prices are entirely too highly volatile and leave most Americans scrambling with a sudden rise. Additionally, by eliminating their sale, we will be able to move forward together towards a cleaner, more green future. In response to those who disagree with this opinion, I understand your apprehension but encourage you to think about the planet you want to leave your children with. At the current state we're going, your children may never know what it's like to breathe outside without a oxygen mask or remember the trees due to the concerns of CO2 production and the ozone layer.",
