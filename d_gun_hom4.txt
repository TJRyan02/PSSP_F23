Guns do not belong in schools and the way to prevent gun violenece is not with more guns, but with more laws and policy to end the spread of gun sales.",

I feel that many educators do not adequately no how to properly use a gun and this policy would ultimately make the situation more dangerous than it already is. Instead, our government needs to focus on taking guns away from those who shouldn’t have them and putting the necessary protections in place to stop dangerous people from getting a gun.",

No amount of training would justify having teachers carry guns, and bringing guns into classrooms and schools would make them less safe. Instead of arming teachers why can’t we increase mental health resources and gun control for minors.",
