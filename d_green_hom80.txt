Stopping the sales of gas-powered vehicles as a whole will significantly reduce a large amount of the carbon footprint in the United States.

One way that we can do this is switching from gasoline powered vehicles to electrically powered cars. Offering government issued incentives to car dealerships to switch to electrically powered vehicles increases the likelihood that dealerships will want to make the switch. Making small changes to our everyday life, like switching the way we power our cars, homes, and buildings is just one way that we can ensure a safe, clean, and prosperous future for generations to come.",
