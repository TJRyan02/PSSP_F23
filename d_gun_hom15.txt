Imagine all of the issues we have now in our education system: racism, sexism, etc. If a teacher was having a bad day, and believe me I've seen some of my teachers have extremely bad days, what's to stop a psychotic break and let all chaos run loose. Additionally, it is preposterous to place a gun within the grasp of a child, especially those in elementary school. Truly anything could happen and this approach is not even slapping a bandaid over a bullet wound, its an approach that would rip that bullet wound even wider and deeper if implemented.",

We shouldn't have to debate whether or not to arm teachers. If teachers had access to guns, imagine how dangerous it would be if an angry/uneducated student got a hold of the gun. It would be an even larger issue. The government needs to focus on gun control before they equip teachers with guns.",

Using guns in general as the main antithesis of gun violence in schools is absurd. <br>Accidents would increase. Consequentially... <br>Cost of training would also need to be considered (it often is not). Teachers would need extensive, expensive firearm training to be allowed to wield weapons around literal children. <br>Firearms should inherently not be around kids. Giving teachers guns would be a slap in the face of child safety concerns.",

If we already have guns in the schools, the risk may run higher for someone to locate the gun. In my opinion, it does not make schools safe, but arguably unsafer.",
